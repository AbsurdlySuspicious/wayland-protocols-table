The role is the purpose of a wl_surface. Examples of roles are a cursor for a pointer (as set by wl_pointer.set_cursor), a drag icon\n(wl_data_device.start_drag), a sub-surface\n(wl_subcompositor.get_subsurface), and a window as defined by a shell protocol (e.g. wl_shell.get_shell_surface).\n\nA surface can have only one role at a time. Initially a wl_surface does not have a role. Once a wl_surface is given a role, it is set permanently for the whole lifetime of the wl_surface object. Giving the current role again is allowed,\nunless explicitly forbidden by the relevant interface specification.\n\nSurface roles are given by requests in other interfaces such as wl_pointer.set_cursor. The request should explicitly mention that this request gives a role to a wl_surface. Often, this request also creates a new protocol object that represents the role and adds additional functionality to wl_surface. When a client wants to destroy a wl_surface, they must destroy this role object before the wl_surface, otherwise a defunct_role_object error is sent.\n\nDestroying the role object does not remove the role from the wl_surface, but it may stop the wl_surface from \"playing the role\".\nFor instance, if a wl_subsurface object is destroyed, the wl_surface it was created for will be unmapped and forget its position and z-order. It is allowed to create a wl_subsurface for the same wl_surface again, but it is not allowed to use the wl_surface as a cursor (cursor is a different role than sub-surface, and role switching is not allowed).",

Sub-surfaces can be arbitrarily nested and create a tree of sub-surfaces.\n\nThe root surface in a tree of sub-surfaces is the main surface. The main surface cannot be a sub-surface, because sub-surfaces must always have a parent.\n\nA main surface with its sub-surfaces forms a (compound) window.\nFor window management purposes, this set of wl_surface objects is to be considered as a single window, and it should also behave as such.\n\nThe aim of sub-surfaces is to offload some of the compositing work within a window from clients to the compositor. A prime example is a video player with decorations and video in separate wl_surface objects. This should allow the compositor to pass YUV video buffer processing to dedicated overlay hardware when possible.",

A sub-surface's size and position are not limited to that of the parent.\nParticularly, a sub-surface is not automatically clipped to its parent's area.\n\nA sub-surface becomes mapped, when a non-NULL wl_buffer is applied and the parent surface is mapped. The order of which one happens first is irrelevant. A sub-surface is hidden if the parent becomes hidden, or if a NULL wl_buffer is applied. These rules apply recursively through the tree of surfaces.\n\nA sub-surface can be in one of two modes. The possible modes are synchronized and desynchronized, see methods wl_subsurface.set_sync and wl_subsurface.set_desync.\n\nThe main surface can be thought to be always in desynchronized mode,\nsince it does not have a parent in the sub-surfaces sense.\n\nEven if a sub-surface is in desynchronized mode, it will behave as in synchronized mode, if its parent surface behaves as in synchronized mode. This rule is applied recursively throughout the tree of surfaces. This means, that one can set a sub-surface into synchronized mode, and then assume that all its child and grand-child sub-surfaces are synchronized, too, without explicitly setting them.\n\nIf a surface behaves as in synchronized mode, it is effectively synchronized, otherwise it is effectively desynchronized.\n\nA sub-surface is initially in the synchronized mode.\n\nThe wl_subsurface interface has requests which modify double-buffered state of the parent surface (wl_subsurface.set_position, .place_above and\n.place_below).\n\nDestroying a sub-surface takes effect immediately. If you need to synchronize the removal of a sub-surface to the parent surface update,\nunmap the sub-surface first by attaching a NULL wl_buffer, update parent,\nand then destroy the sub-surface.\n\nIf the parent wl_surface object is destroyed, the sub-surface is unmapped.\n\nA sub-surface never has the keyboard focus of any seat.\n\nThe wl_surface.offset request is ignored: clients must use set_position instead to move the sub-surface.",

The contents of the source rectangle are scaled to the destination size, and content outside the source rectangle is ignored.\nThis state is double-buffered, see wl_surface.commit.\n\nThe two parts of crop and scale state are independent: the source rectangle, and the destination size. Initially both are unset, that is, no scaling is applied. The whole of the current wl_buffer is used as the source, and the surface size is as defined in wl_surface.attach.\n\nIf the destination size is set, it causes the surface size to become dst_width, dst_height. The source (rectangle) is scaled to exactly this size. This overrides whatever the attached wl_buffer size is,\nunless the wl_buffer is NULL. If the wl_buffer is NULL, the surface has no content and therefore no size. Otherwise, the size is always at least 1x1 in surface local coordinates.\n\nIf the source rectangle is set, it defines what area of the wl_buffer is taken as the source. If the source rectangle is set and the destination size is not set, then src_width and src_height must be integers, and the surface size becomes the source rectangle size. This results in cropping without scaling. If src_width or src_height are not integers and destination size is not set, the bad_size protocol error is raised when the surface state is applied.\n\nThe coordinate transformations from buffer pixel coordinates up to the surface-local coordinates happen in the following order:\n1. buffer_transform (wl_surface.set_buffer_transform)\n2. buffer_scale (wl_surface.set_buffer_scale)\n3. crop and scale (wp_viewport.set*)\nThis means, that the source rectangle coordinates of crop and scale are given in the coordinates after the buffer transform and scale,\ni.e. in the coordinates that would be the surface-local coordinates if the crop and scale was not applied.\n\nIf src_x or src_y are negative, the bad_value protocol error is raised.\nOtherwise, if the source rectangle is partially or completely outside of the non-NULL wl_buffer, then the out_of_buffer protocol error is raised when the surface state is applied. A NULL wl_buffer does not raise the out_of_buffer error.\n\nIf the wl_surface associated with the wp_viewport is destroyed,\nall wp_viewport requests except 'destroy' raise the protocol error no_surface.\n\nIf the wp_viewport object is destroyed, the crop and scale state is removed from the wl_surface. The change will be applied on the next wl_surface.commit.",

This means the server may at any time use those fds to import the dmabuf into any kernel sub-system that might accept it.\n\nHowever, when the underlying graphics stack fails to deliver the promise, because of e.g. a device hot-unplug which raises internal errors, after the wl_buffer has been successfully created the compositor must not raise protocol errors to the client when dmabuf import later fails.\n\nTo create a wl_buffer from one or more dmabufs, a client creates a zwp_linux_dmabuf_params_v1 object with a zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1.create_params request. All planes required by the intended format are added with the 'add' request. Finally, a 'create' or 'create_immed' request is issued, which has the following outcome depending on the import success.\n\nThe 'create' request,\n- on success, triggers a 'created' event which provides the final wl_buffer to the client.\n- on failure, triggers a 'failed' event to convey that the server cannot use the dmabufs received from the client.\n\nFor the 'create_immed' request,\n- on success, the server immediately imports the added dmabufs to create a wl_buffer. No event is sent from the server in this case.\n- on failure, the server can choose to either:\n- terminate the client by raising a fatal error.\n- mark the wl_buffer as failed, and send a 'failed' event to the client. If the client uses a failed wl_buffer as an argument to any request, the behaviour is compositor implementation-defined.\n\nFor all DRM formats and unless specified in another protocol extension,\npre-multiplied alpha is used for pixel values.\n\nUnless specified otherwise in another protocol extension, implicit synchronization is used. In other words, compositors and clients must wait and signal fences implicitly passed via the DMA-BUF's reservation mechanism.",

                    "text": "This description provides a high-level overview of the interplay between the interfaces defined this protocol. For details, see the protocol specification.\n\nMore than one tablet may exist, and device-specifics matter. Tablets are not represented by a single virtual device like wl_pointer. A client binds to the tablet manager object which is just a proxy object. From that, the client requests zwp_tablet_manager_v2.get_tablet_seat(wl_seat)\nand that returns the actual interface that has all the tablets. With this indirection, we can avoid merging zwp_tablet_v2 into the actual Wayland protocol, a long-term benefit.\n\nThe zwp_tablet_seat_v2 sends a \"tablet added\" event for each tablet connected. That event is followed by descriptive events about the hardware; currently that includes events for name, vid/pid and a zwp_tablet_v2.path event that describes a local path. This path can be used to uniquely identify a tablet or get more information through libwacom. Emulated or nested tablets can skip any of those, e.g. a virtual tablet may not have a vid/pid. The sequence of descriptive events is terminated by a zwp_tablet_v2.done event to signal that a client may now finalize any initialization for that tablet.\n\nEvents from tablets require a tool in proximity. Tools are also managed by the tablet seat; a \"tool added\" event is sent whenever a tool is new to the compositor. That event is followed by a number of descriptive events about the hardware; currently that includes capabilities,\nhardware id and serial number, and tool type. Similar to the tablet interface, a zwp_tablet_tool_v2.done event is sent to terminate that initial sequence.\n\nAny event from a tool happens on the zwp_tablet_tool_v2 interface. When the tool gets into proximity of the tablet, a proximity_in event is sent on the zwp_tablet_tool_v2 interface, listing the tablet and the surface. That event is followed by a motion event with the coordinates. After that,\nit's the usual motion, axis, button, etc. events. The protocol's serialisation means events are grouped by zwp_tablet_tool_v2.frame events.\n\nTwo special events (that don't exist in X) are down and up. They signal\n\"tip touching the surface\". For tablets without real proximity detection, the sequence is: proximity_in, motion, down, frame.\n\nWhen the tool leaves proximity, a proximity_out event is sent. If any button is still down, a button release event is sent before this proximity event. These button events are sent in the same frame as the proximity event to signal to the client that the buttons were held when the tool left proximity.\n\nIf the tool moves out of the surface but stays in proximity (i.e.\nbetween windows), compositor-specific grab policies apply. This usually means that the proximity-out is delayed until all buttons are released.\n\nMoving a tool physically from one tablet to the other has no real effect on the protocol, since we already have the tool object from the \"tool added\" event. All the information is already there and the proximity events on both tablets are all a client needs to reconstruct what happened.\n\nSome extra axes are normalized, i.e. the client knows the range as specified in the protocol (e.g. [0, 65535]), the granularity however is unknown. The current normalized axes are pressure, distance, and slider.\n\nOther extra axes are in physical units as specified in the protocol.\nThe current extra axes with physical units are tilt, rotation and wheel rotation.\n\nSince tablets work independently of the pointer controlled by the mouse,\nthe focus handling is independent too and controlled by proximity.\nThe zwp_tablet_tool_v2.set_cursor request sets a tool-specific cursor.\nThis cursor surface may be the same as the mouse cursor, and it may be the same across tools but it is possible to be more fine-grained. For example, a client may set different cursors for the pen and eraser.\n\nTools are generally independent of tablets and it is compositor-specific policy when a tool can be removed. Common approaches will likely include some form of removing a tool when all tablets the tool was used on are removed.",

The child process should unset the environment variable again right after reading it out in order to avoid propagating it to other child processes.\n\nAnother established way exists for Applications implementing the D-Bus interface org.freedesktop.Application, which should get their token under activation-token on their platform_data.\n\nIn general activation tokens may be transferred across clients through means not described in this protocol.\n\nThe client to be activated will then pass the token it received to the xdg_activation_v1.activate request. The compositor can then use this token to decide how to react to the activation request.\n\nThe token the activating client gets may be ineffective either already at the time it receives it, for example if it was not focused, for focus stealing prevention. The activating client will have no way to discover the validity of the token, and may still forward it to the to be activated client.\n\nThe created activation token may optionally get information attached to it that can be used by the compositor to identify the application that we intend to activate. This can for example be used to display a visual hint about what application is being started.\n\nWarning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing phase.

Most GPU clients will schedule an asynchronous operation to render to the buffer, then immediately send the buffer to the compositor to be attached to a surface.\n\nWith implicit synchronization, ensuring that the rendering operation is complete before the compositor displays the buffer is an implementation detail handled by either the kernel or userspace graphics driver.\n\nBy contrast, with explicit synchronization, DRM synchronization object timeline points mark when the asynchronous operations are complete. When submitting a buffer, the client provides a timeline point which will be waited on before the compositor accesses the buffer, and another timeline point that the compositor will signal when it no longer needs to access the buffer contents for the purposes of the surface commit.\n\nLinux DRM synchronization objects are documented at:\nhttps://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/gpu/drm-mm.html#drm-sync-objects\n\nWarning!

This means that the compositor must stop rendering and providing input to normal clients. Instead the compositor must blank all outputs with an opaque color such that their normal content is fully hidden.\n\nThe only surfaces that should be rendered while the session is locked are the lock surfaces created through this interface and optionally,\nat the compositor's discretion, special privileged surfaces such as input methods or portions of desktop shell UIs.\n\nThe locked event must not be sent until a new \"locked\" frame (either from a session lock surface or the compositor blanking the output) has been presented on all outputs and no security sensitive normal/unlocked content is possibly visible.\n\nThe finished event should be sent immediately on creation of this object if the compositor decides that the locked event will not be sent.\n\nThe compositor may wait for the client to create and render session lock surfaces before sending the locked event to avoid displaying intermediate blank frames. However, it must impose a reasonable time limit if waiting and send the locked event as soon as the hard requirements described above can be met if the time limit expires. Clients should immediately create lock surfaces for all outputs on creation of this object to make this possible.\n\nThis behavior of the locked event is required in order to prevent possible race conditions with clients that wish to suspend the system or similar after locking the session. Without these semantics, clients triggering a suspend after receiving the locked event would race with the first \"locked\" frame being presented and normal/unlocked frames might be briefly visible as the system is resumed if the suspend operation wins the race.\n\nIf the client dies while the session is locked, the compositor must not unlock the session in response. It is acceptable for the session to be permanently locked if this happens. The compositor may choose to continue to display the lock surfaces the client had mapped before it died or alternatively fall back to a solid color, this is compositor policy.\n\nCompositors may also allow a secure way to recover the session, the details of this are compositor policy. Compositors may allow a new client to create a ext_session_lock_v1 object and take responsibility for unlocking the session, they may even start a new lock client instance automatically.",

Committing the surface with a null buffer at any time is a protocol error.\n\nThe compositor is free to handle keyboard/pointer focus for lock surfaces however it chooses.

This allows having detachable parts of a window that when dragged out of it become a new window and can be dragged over an existing window to be reattached.\n\nA typical workflow would be when the user starts dragging on top of a detachable part of a window, the client would create a wl_data_source and a xdg_toplevel_drag_v1 object and start the drag as normal via wl_data_device.start_drag. Once the client determines that the detachable window contents should be detached from the originating window, it creates a new xdg_toplevel with these contents and issues a xdg_toplevel_drag_v1.attach request before mapping it. From now on the new window is moved by the compositor during the drag as if the client called xdg_toplevel.move.\n\nDragging an existing window is similar. The client creates a xdg_toplevel_drag_v1 object and attaches the existing toplevel before starting the drag.\n\nClients use the existing drag and drop mechanism to detect when a window can be docked or undocked. If the client wants to snap a window into a parent window it should delete or unmap the dragged top-level. If the contents should be detached again it attaches a new toplevel as described above. If a drag operation is cancelled without being dropped, clients should revert to the previous state, deleting any newly created windows as appropriate. When a drag operation ends as indicated by wl_data_source.dnd_drop_performed the dragged toplevel window's final position is determined as if a xdg_toplevel_move operation ended.\n\nWarning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.",

In this way, it is possible for each output to have its own set of workspaces, or for all outputs (or any other arbitrary grouping) to share workspaces. Compositors may optionally conceptually arrange each group of workspaces in an N-dimensional grid.\n\nThe purpose of this protocol is to enable the creation of taskbars and docks by providing them with a list of workspaces and their properties,\nand allowing them to activate and deactivate workspaces.\n\nAfter a client binds the ext_workspace_manager_v1, each workspace will be sent via the workspace event.",

All surface contents must be readily intended for some display, but not necessarily for the display at hand. Doing this enables a compositor to perform automatic color management of content for different outputs according to how content is intended to look like.\n\nFor an introduction, see the section \"Color management\" in the Wayland documentation at https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/ .\n\nThe color properties are represented as an image description object which is immutable after it has been created. A wl_output always has an associated image description that clients can observe. A wl_surface always has an associated preferred image description as a hint chosen by the compositor that clients can also observe. Clients can set an image description on a wl_surface to denote the color characteristics of the surface contents.\n\nAn image description essentially defines a display and (indirectly) its viewing environment. An image description includes SDR and HDR colorimetry and encoding, HDR metadata, and some parameters related to the viewing environment. An image description does not include the properties set through color-representation extension. It is expected that the color-representation extension is used in conjunction with the color-management extension when necessary, particularly with the YUV family of pixel formats.\n\nThe normative appendix for this protocol is in the appendix.md file beside this XML file.\n\nThe color-and-hdr repository\n(https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pq/color-and-hdr) contains background information on the protocol design and legacy color management.\nIt also contains a glossary, learning resources for digital color, tools,\nsamples and more.\n\nThe terminology used in this protocol is based on common color science and color encoding terminology where possible. The glossary in the color-and-hdr repository shall be the authority on the definition of terms in this protocol.\n\nWarning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.",

When submitting a buffer, the client provides an acquire fence which will be waited on before the compositor accesses the buffer. The Wayland server, through a zwp_linux_buffer_release_v1 object, will inform the client with an event which may be accompanied by a release fence, when the compositor will no longer access the buffer contents due to the specific commit that requested the release event.\n\nEach surface can be associated with only one object of this interface at any time.\n\nIn version 1 of this interface, explicit synchronization is only guaranteed to be supported for buffers created with any version of the wp_linux_dmabuf buffer factory. Version 2 additionally guarantees explicit synchronization support for opaque EGL buffers, which is a type of platform specific buffers described in the EGL_WL_bind_wayland_display extension.

After having created the relative pointer manager proxy object, the client uses it to create the actual relative pointer object using the\n\"get_relative_pointer\" request given a wl_pointer. The relative pointer motion events will then, when applicable, be transmitted via the proxy of the newly created relative pointer object. See the documentation of the relative pointer interface for more details.\n\nWarning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number is reset.",

With such a reference, a client can, by using the interfaces provided by this protocol, manipulate the relationship between its own surfaces and the surface of some other client. For example, stack some of its own surface above the other clients surface.\n\nIn order for a client A to get a reference of a surface of client B, client B must first export its surface using xdg_exporter.export_toplevel. Upon doing this, client B will receive a handle (a unique string) that it may share with client A in some way (for example D-Bus). After client A has received the handle from client B, it may use xdg_importer.import_toplevel to create a reference to the surface client B just exported. See the corresponding requests for details.\n\nA possible use case for this is out-of-process dialogs. For example when a sandboxed client without file system access needs the user to select a file on the file system, given sandbox environment support, it can export its surface, passing the exported surface handle to an unsandboxed process that can show a file browser dialog and stack it above the sandboxed client's surface.\n\nWarning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number is reset.",

It provides a way for Xwayland to request all keyboard events to be forwarded to a surface even when the surface does not have keyboard focus.\n\nIn the X11 protocol, a client may request an \"active grab\" on the keyboard. On success, all key events are reported only to the grabbing X11 client. For details, see XGrabKeyboard(3).\n\nThe core Wayland protocol does not have a notion of an active keyboard grab. When running in Xwayland, X11 applications may acquire an active grab inside Xwayland but that cannot be translated to the Wayland compositor who may set the input focus to some other surface. In doing so, it breaks the X11 client assumption that all key events are reported to the grabbing client.\n\nThis protocol specifies a way for Xwayland to request all keyboard be directed to the given surface. The protocol does not guarantee that the compositor will honor this request and it does not prescribe user interfaces on how to handle the respond. For example,\na compositor may inform the user that all key events are now forwarded to the given client surface, or it may ask the user for permission to do so.\n\nCompositors are required to restrict access to this application specific protocol to Xwayland alone.\n\nWarning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.\nBackward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol is to be declared stable,\nthe 'z' prefix and the version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number is reset.",

Each head may have one or more available modes.\n\nWhenever a head appears (e.g. a monitor is plugged in), it will be advertised via the head event. Immediately after the output manager is bound, all current heads are advertised.\n\nWhenever a head's properties change, the relevant wlr_output_head events will be sent. Not all head properties will be sent: only properties that have changed need to.\n\nWhenever a head disappears (e.g. a monitor is unplugged), a wlr_output_head.finished event will be sent.\n\nAfter one or more heads appear, change or disappear, the done event will be sent. It carries a serial which can be used in a create_configuration request to update heads properties.\n\nThe information obtained from this protocol should only be used for output configuration purposes.

In order to configure outputs a client requests create_configuration, which provides a resource referencing an outputconfiguration for one-time configuration. That way the server knows which requests belong together and can group them by that.\n\nOn the outputconfiguration object the client calls for each output whether the output should be enabled, which mode should be set (by referencing the mode from the list of announced modes) and the output's global position. Once all outputs are configured that way, the client calls apply.\nAt that point and not earlier the server should try to apply the configuration.\nIf this succeeds the server emits the applied signal, otherwise the failed signal, such that the configuring client is noticed about the success of its configuration request.\n\nThrough this design the interface enables atomic output configuration changes if internally supported by the server.\n\nWarning!

In this way, it is possible for each output to have its own set of workspaces, or for all outputs (or any other arbitrary grouping) to share workspaces.

Client applications should not wait for the protection to change, as it might never change in case the content-protection cannot be achieved. Alternatively, clients can use a timeout and start showing the content in lower quality.\n\nCensored visibility is defined as the compositor censoring the protected content on non-secure outputs.

The client waits for the compositor to send a configure event before it starts drawing the first calibration pattern.\nAfter receiving the configure event, the client will iterate drawing a pattern, getting touch input via weston_touch_calibrator, and converting pixel coordinates to expected touch coordinates with weston_touch_calibrator.convert until it has enough correspondences to compute the calibration transformation or the compositor cancels the calibration.\n\nOnce the client has successfully computed a new calibration, it can use weston_touch_calibration.save request to load the new calibration into the compositor. The compositor may take this new calibration into use and may write it into persistent storage.",

The compositor sends a configure event which the client must obey with the associated wl_surface.\n\nOnce the client has committed content to the surface, the compositor can grab the touch input device, prevent it from emitting normal touch events, show the surface on the correct output, and relay input events from the touch device via this protocol object.\n\nTouch events from other touch devices than the one tied to this object must generate wrong_touch events on at least touch-down and must not generate normal or calibration touch events.\n\nAt any time, the compositor can choose to cancel the calibration procedure by sending the cancel_calibration event. This should also be used if the touch device disappears or anything else prevents the calibration from continuing on the compositor side.\n\nIf the wl_surface is destroyed, the compositor must cancel the calibration.\n\nThe touch event coordinates and conversion results are delivered in calibration units. The calibration units cover the device coordinate range exactly. Calibration units are in the closed interval [0.0, 1.0]\nmapped into 32-bit unsigned integers. An integer can be converted into a real value by dividing by 2^32-1. A calibration matrix must be computed from the [0.0, 1.0] real values, but the matrix elements do not need to fall into that range.",

The compositor should use the unavailable event if necessary to enforce this.\n\nThere are two disjoint categories of state managed by this protocol:\n\nWindow management state influences the communication between the server and individual window clients (e.g. xdg_toplevels). Window management state includes window dimensions, fullscreen state, keyboard focus,\nkeyboard bindings, and more.\n\nRendering state only affects the rendered output of the compositor and does not influence communication between the server and individual window clients. Rendering state includes the position and rendering order of windows, shell surfaces, decoration surfaces, borders, and more.\n\nWindow management state may only be modified by the window manager as part of a manage sequence. A manage sequence is started with the manage_start event and ended with the manage_finish request. It is a protocol error to modify window management state outside of a manage sequence.\n\nA manage sequence is always followed by at least one render sequence. A render sequence is started with the render_start event and ended with the render_finish request.\n\nRendering state may be modified by the window manager during a manage sequence or a render sequence. Regardless of when the rendering state is modified, it is applied with the next render_finish request. It is a protocol error to modify rendering state outside of a manage or render sequence.\n\nThe server will start a manage sequence by sending new state and the manage_start event as soon as possible whenever there is a change in state that must be communicated with the window manager.\n\nIf the window manager client needs to ensure a manage sequence is started due to a state change the compositor is not aware of, it may send the manage_dirty request.\n\nThe server will start a render sequence by sending new state and the render_start event as soon as possible whenever there is a change in window dimensions that must be communicated with the window manager.\nMultiple render sequences may be made consecutively without a manage sequence in between, for example if a window independently changes its own dimensions.\n\nTo summarize, the main loop of this protocol is as follows:\n\n1. The server sends events indicating all changes since the last manage sequence followed by the manage_start event.\n\n2. The client sends requests modifying window management state or rendering state (as defined above) followed by the manage_finish request.\n\n3. The server sends new state to windows and waits for responses.\n\n4. The server sends new window dimensions to the client followed by the render_start event.\n\n5. The client sends requests modifying rendering state (as defined above)\nfollowed by the render_finish request.\n\n6. If window dimensions change, loop back to step 4.\nIf state that requires a manage sequence changes or if the client makes a manage_dirty request, loop back to step 1.\n\nFor the purposes of frame perfection, the server may delay rendering new state committed by the windows in step 3 until after step 5 is finished.\n\nIt is a protocol error for the client to make a manage_finish or render_finish request that violates this ordering.",

A client performing such operations should account for it and damage the parent non-augmented wl_surface accordingly.\n\nVarious changes like adding or removing an augmented sub-surface, changing its position or stacking order, will not introduce extra damage on the compositor side. The parent wl_surface should account for the extra damage introduced.\n\nThis surface, using a wl_subsurface role of its parent, cannot be stacked relative to non-augmented sub-surfaces of the parent, but can be stacked relative to other augmented children. Nor can this surface have non-augmented sub-surface children.\n\nA mixed tree structure of using augmented_surfaces to delegate composite wl_surfaces would look like this:\n\nwl_surface@1:{ augmented_surface@1,2,3 }\n/           \\_____\n/                   \\\nwl_surface@2:               wl_surface@3:\n{ augmented_surface@4,5 }   { augmented_surface@6 }\n\nEvery wl_surface has a list of augmented_surfaces.
